# GitHub Security Advisory

Write all fill-in content in English (GitHub Advisory form). Do not use Chinese in Title, Description, or Severity notes. Copy from `### Summary` through Impact into the Description field. Leave Patched versions empty if there is no upstream fix.

Do not render this file as HTML in the product UI; keep it as copy-paste Markdown source.

## Title

## Description

Copy from the next `### Summary` through the end of Impact.

### Summary

(One short paragraph: what a low-privilege caller can do, which endpoint/field, and why existing checks do not stop it.)

### Details

(Root cause, file/function, the intended control that was skipped, auth preconditions, same-root-cause siblings, and a concrete suggested fix.)

### Vulnerable code

(Required. Give the full in-repo relative path of the vulnerable snippet, not just a class or method name, and paste the source verbatim in a fenced block. Optional line number, e.g. `src/.../File.ext:42`.)

- Path: `src/.../File.ext`

```text

```

### PoC

Requires a running instance you are authorized to test. Do not include real secrets.

**Must include at least one raw HTTP request packet** in a `http` fenced block (method, path, headers, and body if any). Do not rely on curl one-liners or screenshots alone. Contrast blocked vs accepted requests/responses when that proves the bypass.

For header or body values that are long (roughly 80+ characters, e.g. Base64 blobs, serialized gadgets, JWTs), replace the long portion with a short descriptive placeholder such as `<BASE64_PAYLOAD>`, `<JWT_TOKEN>`, or `<SERIALIZED_GADGET>` while keeping the surrounding structure and short attack primitives intact.

Optionally reference the reproducible CLI script in the same directory (`python poc.py -u http://TARGET:PORT`; add `--proxy` when needed; add `--zh` for Chinese labels). For a library issue with no HTTP surface, describe the public API call instead; do not copy `harness.py`.

```http

```

Do not run this against systems you do not own or have authorization to test.

### Impact

(CWE, who is affected, who can exploit it, what it enables. State remaining controls honestly; do not overclaim.)
