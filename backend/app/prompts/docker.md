# Build / reuse a Docker lab for whitebox dynamic verification

You help VulnHunter stand up a reusable lab under `env/` for the audited Web project.
This is a dedicated Reviewer round that starts after source ingest - do not review vulnerabilities in this round.

## Goals
1. Prefer existing Dockerfile / compose in the project `src/` over inventing from scratch.
2. Expose the service port; write `env/env.json`.
3. Enable remote debug when practical:
   - Java: JDWP → `jdwp_*`
   - Node: `--inspect` → `inspect_*`
   - Python: debugpy → `debugpy_*`
4. `runtime` may be any Web language (php/go/ruby/dotnet/…). Debug ports only required for java/nodejs/python.
5. Record credentials when you create logins.
6. `lab_state`: `setup` or `ready` (past first-run wizard when needed).
7. When the Docker lab is reachable and `env/env.json` has `"accepted": true` plus `"status": "running"`, write `docs/lab.md` with the setup/reuse notes.

## Naming (required)
Every lab resource must be identifiable by this project's name and ID. Use these exact names:

- Compose project (`name:` in compose, or `docker compose -p`): `${lab_compose_project}`
- Image you **build** from this repo: `${lab_image}` (`docker build -t ${lab_image} ${lab_label_args} …`). Extra built services: `${lab_compose_project}-<role>:lab` (role like `executor`)
- Official pulled images (mysql, redis, nginx, …): keep the upstream name; do **not** retag them as vulnhunter-*
- Container serving `target_url`: `${lab_container}` (`docker run --name` / compose `container_name`)
- Sidecar containers: `${lab_container}-<role>` (`-db`, `-redis`, `-mysql`, `-executor`, …)
- Optional user-defined network: `${lab_compose_project}-net`
- Labels (required on every container you start, and on images you build): `${lab_label_args}`  
  Compose equivalent on each service:
  ```yaml
  labels:
    vulnhunter: "1"
    vulnhunter.project: "${project_id}"
  ```

Do not use the `env` directory as the compose project name, random tags, `<none>` dangling images, or upstream names like `org/app:local` for images you build.

## env.json schema
```json
{
  "accepted": true,
  "runtime": "java|nodejs|python|php|go|ruby|dotnet|other",
  "image": "${lab_image}",
  "container_id": "...",
  "container_name": "${lab_container}",
  "host_port": 18080,
  "container_port": 8080,
  "jdwp_host_port": 15005,
  "jdwp_container_port": 5005,
  "inspect_host_port": 19229,
  "inspect_container_port": 9229,
  "debugpy_host_port": 15678,
  "debugpy_container_port": 5678,
  "target_url": "http://127.0.0.1:18080",
  "lab_state": "setup|ready",
  "credentials": {"username": "admin", "password": "..."},
  "notes": "...",
  "status": "running"
}
```

Record the **Web** image/container in `image` / `container_name`. Sidecars belong in compose, not as a second env.json.

## Rules
- **Audited app = latest (required):** The Web app in this lab must be the current ingested tree in `src/`. Build from `src/`; do not swap in an older product release, old git tag, Docker Hub app image, or vulhub/historical target just to make a known CVE easier. If compose pins an old **application** image, build from `src/` instead. Sidecar images (mysql, redis, …) follow the project; this rule is not about those.
- Bind debug ports to 127.0.0.1; keep business ports separate.
- Set `"accepted": true` only when the **application itself** is reachable (login/portal/health or the real business URL). A Tomcat/nginx default page 200 or `docker ps` is not enough.
- Keep `docs/lab.md` concise but complete enough to reproduce/reuse the lab: target URL, image/container, ports, credentials created for the lab, startup command, and notes.
- One project shares one lab across vulns (reuse, do not rebuild per vuln unless broken).
- Standing up this Docker lab is required. Do not skip it because bounty mode forbids "creating exploit preconditions"; those rules ban planting payloads / non-default files, not docker.
